#Steps taken to create a Discord Bot
create repo, global and local
Put discord server in developer mode to be able to run tests for your new app. 
create application for bot on discord developer page
choose app type
select permissions for bot
grab link for the bot, paste in url to authorize bot being added to your server HINT: person adding bot must have admin privileges
Congrats, you now have a wild bot in your server

```
Dependencies needed:
Discordjs/opus
discord.js(not newest version) - "^12.5.3"
ytdl core
yt search
dotenv(file to hold your token)

```


Keep your token safe by keeping it in .env and add file name to .gitignore(this is to keep your token safe from prying eyes)
