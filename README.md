# Creating a Discord Bot
- Create repository
- Put discord server in developer mode to be able to run tests for your new app. 
- Create application for bot on discord developer page.
- Choose app scope(bot).
- Select permissions for bot to have within server.
- Grab link for the bot and paste in url to authorize bot being added to your server.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**HINT:** *The person adding the bot must have admin privileges.*
- Congrats, you now have a wild bot in your server

```
Dependencies needed:
(npm install *dependencies*)
discordjs/opus
discord.js@12
ytdl-core
yt-search
dotenv
ffmpeg
```


Keep your token safe by keeping it in .env and add file name to .gitignore(this is to keep your token safe from prying eyes ðŸ‘€)


Now, It's time to code your bot. 

First you want to add a folder, in which you will add 6 more files:
- command folder
- play.js file
- stop.js file
- pause.js file
- ping.js file
- skip.js file
- queue.js file

The next file will be created in the main folder.

- bot.js file (*this is where the main bot functions will be coded*.)

The purpose of this is keep your code clean and easy to read; avoiding clutter in your code.
